# Recommender-Systems
Some of the Python sample code I worked on for my former company in helping users  recommend products, movies and candidates.

I started with very simple item-item collaborative filtering method to recommend relevant products from the superstore datasets that is provided by Tableau. You may find the data here: https://community.tableau.com/docs/DOC-1236

The collaborative filtering(CF) uses actions of users to suggest the similar items that may have similar features. To implement CF, KNN is one of the simplest and effective methods to select from.
